# Stock-Price-Prediction using ML Models

###This project focuses on forecasting stock prices for the upcoming 30 days by leveraging machine learning and time-series models. Predicting stock market movements is essential for investors and financial analysts to make data-driven decisions, yet it remains a challenging task due to the market's unpredictable and volatile nature.

We use models such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and ARIMA to predict future stock prices. By analyzing historical stock data, we train these models to recognize trends and patterns that can inform accurate forecasts. The models are evaluated using performance metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R2 Score, helping identify the most effective approach for prediction.

This project demonstrates how machine learning techniques can be applied to stock market forecasting, exploring various methods to manage the complexities involved in predicting stock price movements.
